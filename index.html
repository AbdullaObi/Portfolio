                <p> Throughout my life I have always appreciated the value of technology. Where as soon as I got the
                    chance to dive deeper into it in pursuing Computer Science at City, University of London, I couldn’t
                    say no to the offer. I graduated from my home country in 2020. Where I attended Qatar Academy, one
                    of the most successful schools in Qatar Foundation. Being there for my entire life essentially
                    helped build up a family of friends and meet likeminded people whom have allowed me to grow
                    throughout the years.




                <p>Currently, I’m exploring the realms of 2D game design. This has allowed for a deeper appreciation of
                    games to grow. Understanding the complexity and the amount of hours required to design games, make
                    them unique and enjoyable made me fall back in love with older and newer games. I have been
                    searching and attempting to grow my knowledge with games as I have become fascinated by it.
                    Hopefully I can stay in this path and explore this journey fully. </p>

                <br>
                Plat-former, is a Two dimensional game that I have created over the past semester. My projects
                journey was an amazing opportunity for me to explore the world of game design. As well as, gaining
                experience as I was introduced too many new features that were unknown to me before.
